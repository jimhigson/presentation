Intro
=====

* What dev cafe is
* Nothing new here, mostly of interest to devs
* Quick summary (and personal vision) of techniques I've picked up at different places
* Don't expect will be able to do everything



Agile principles
================

* Self organising teams require control of tooling
* End-to-end work.



Artisan coding
==============

Friction now
------------
* 20 minute start time
* editor freezes whenever save a JSP

Ideal future
------------

* Editor makes clear what has changed (vcs gutter and easy diffs)
* demo: beta search auto-restart - make an edit + commit



TDD
===

* demo: Oboe.js run tests on save



VCS, CI deploys
===============

Problems now
------------

* Manual packaging

Future
------

* Deploying often requires easy deploys

Demo: Nodejitsu deploy
----------------------

* Only 1 line of config
* Run it



Use the cloud
=============

Friction now
------------
*  named servers, named environments
* projects being delayed to buy new hardware
* taking the site down to deploy
   * SEO
   * ok for 6-monthly cycle, not for 2-week and certainly not for kanban
   
Ideal future
------------



Hacks
=====

An example of improving our tools (good!)

"when all you have is a hammer every problem starts to look like a nail"



System architecture
===================

now
---

* Monolith
* Tightly coupled

star
----

* Small, light, fast
* Loose coupling
* Out-of-sync deploys
