Intro
=====

* Nothing new here

Agile principles
================

* Self organising teams require control of tooling
* End-to-end work.

Artisan coding
==============

Friction now.
* 20 minute start time
* editor freezes whenever save a JSP

Ideal future

* Editor makes clear what has changed (vcs gutter and easy diffs)
* demo: beta search auto-restart - make an edit + commit

TDD
===

* demo: Oboe.js run tests on save

CI and deploys
==============

* Deploying often requires easy deploys

* demo: nodejitsu deploy

Use the cloud
=============

* now: named servers, named environments
* projects being delayed to buy new hardware
* taking the site down to deploy
   * SEO
   * ok for 6-monthly cycle, not for 2-week and certainly not for kanban

Hacks

An example of improving our tools (good!)
