Intro
=====

* What dev cafe is
* Nothing new here
* Quick summary of techniques I've picked up at different places 



Agile principles
================

* Self organising teams require control of tooling
* End-to-end work.



Artisan coding
==============

Friction now
------------
* 20 minute start time
* editor freezes whenever save a JSP

Ideal future
------------

* Editor makes clear what has changed (vcs gutter and easy diffs)
* demo: beta search auto-restart - make an edit + commit



TDD
===

* demo: Oboe.js run tests on save



CI and deploys
==============

* Deploying often requires easy deploys

* demo: nodejitsu deploy



Use the cloud
=============

Friction now
------------
*  named servers, named environments
* projects being delayed to buy new hardware
* taking the site down to deploy
   * SEO
   * ok for 6-monthly cycle, not for 2-week and certainly not for kanban
   
Ideal future
