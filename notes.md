%  1) SEARCH BETA: auto restart (entr/grunt)
%                  what to edit?

%  2) Oboe.js: run tests on save
 
%  3) Nodejitsu - edit and deploy Oboe.js website


Cafe
=====

* What dev cafe is



Profit
======

* Nothing new here, mostly of interest to devs
* Quick summary (and personal vision) of techniques I've picked up at different places
* Don't expect will be able to do everything



Artisan coding
==============

Friction now
------------
* editor freezes whenever save a JSP
* 20 minute start time (Java)
* can edit locally for some file types
   * nails/hammers

Ideal future
------------

* Editor makes clear what has changed (vcs gutter and easy diffs)

demo
----
* Beta search auto-restart - make an edit + commit
* Working locally on FE. Service could be remote.


TDD
===

Fit it into work processes

demo
----
Oboe.js run tests on save



VCS, CI deploys
===============

Problems now
------------

* Manual packaging

Future
------

* Deploying often requires easy deploys

Demo: Nodejitsu deploy
----------------------

* Only 1 line of config
* Run it



Use the cloud
=============

Friction now
------------
*  named servers, named environments
* projects being delayed to buy new hardware
* taking the site down to deploy
   * SEO
   * ok for 6-monthly cycle, not for 2-week and certainly not for kanban
   
Ideal future
------------



System architecture
===================

now
---

* Monolith
* Tightly coupled

star
----

* Small, light, fast
* Loose coupling
* Out-of-sync deploys






% maybe not include...


Agile principles
================

* Self organising teams require control of tooling
* End-to-end work.



Hacks

An example of improving our tools (good!)
